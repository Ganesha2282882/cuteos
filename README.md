# cuteos
My very own Operating System. Polar bear ➡️ Don't eat it!

To compile:
```bash
gh repo clone https://github.com/Ganesha2282882/cuteos
sudo apt install xorriso -y
cd cuteos
grub-mkrescue . --output=$HOME/CuteOS.iso --product-name=CuteOS --product-version="White Toad"
```

And it's really fast. (At least on a DOS computer. It's slow on a modern machine which is ironic.)
